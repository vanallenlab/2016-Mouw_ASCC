# Genomic Evolution After Chemoradiotherapy in Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
## Introduction
This repository contains code generated, and corresponding raw data, for 2016 Mouw et al, Genomic Evolution After Chemoradiotherapy in Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma. This paper is available (http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2017/03/14/1078-0432.CCR-16-2017.full-text.pdf) 

All figures and statistics created for the paper are shown in ASCC-ipython_master.ipynb

## Dependencies 
Python 2.7 was primarily used for all data manipulation, calculations, and figure generation. The best way to acquire all packages used may be to [download Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Specific python packages used are commented at the top of ASCC-ipython_master.ipynb

## Usage 
Due to file size constraints, we were unable to upload the proper version of "cosmic_v75.txt" and "exac_GATK.txt" (located under storage/reference/) to this repository. Please run ASCC-get_db.sh to download these two files off of dropbox.

After forking or downloading the repository, update these two files by:
```bash
bash ASCC-get_db.sh
```
